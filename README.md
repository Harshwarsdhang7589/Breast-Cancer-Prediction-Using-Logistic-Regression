# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Summary

This project predicts breast cancer (benign or malignant) using several machine learning models. It is developed for real-world use and aims to help frontline healthcare workers—including rural nurses—quickly identify patients at risk.

## What I Learned

- Built the end-to-end ML workflow from scratch.
- Explored logistic regression, SVM, AdaBoost, and XGBoost classifiers.
- Practiced real-time deployment using Gradio, Google Colab, and Kaggle.
- Gained hands-on experience with feature engineering, data cleaning, and model evaluation.

## Tools Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Gradio (for interactive web UI and demo)
- Google Colab (for code development and testing)
- Kaggle (for dataset and prototyping)
- Matplotlib, seaborn (for data visualization)

## Main ML Libraries

- scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Gradio

## Use Case

- Enables rural nurses and doctors to predict breast cancer easily and quickly using ML-powered tools.
- Useful for rapid and reliable screening, even in resource-limited areas.

## Files Included

- `cancer_detection.ipynb` : Source notebook with code, models, and results.
- `RESEARCH-PAPER.pdf` : Published paper for reference.
- `Cancer-Prediction01.jpg` : Sample UI screenshot.

## How it Works

1. Data is preprocessed and cleaned from the [Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic).
2. Models are trained and evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
3. Deployment using Gradio lets users interact with sliders for inputs and view predictions.

## How to Run

You can run the project effortlessly by opening the notebook in Google Colab or running the UI locally with Gradio.
